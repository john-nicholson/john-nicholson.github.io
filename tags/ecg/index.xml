      <description>Okay I wrote a series of blog posts last year when I started at the Easter Colleges Group now I thought again before publishing these as I didnâ€™t want anyone to this this was overly critical or airing our dirty laundry. In reality simply writing the posts was theaputic.
I do once again want to note however the awesome time that I had working at the eastern colleges group and I really cannot believe how mauch we achieved in such a short time frame.</description>

      <description>So I thought these posts would happen more regularly; it&amp;rsquo;s just been intense getting to know so many people. Bringing together three teams distributed across our campuses has been a great deal of fun. Each is unique, with its distinct strengths and culture. Today I shared our strategy for IT across the group. While I get nervous speaking in front of people, I love these moments. It&amp;rsquo;s the big reveal of the analysis and work that has been amassed over the last 6 months.</description>
