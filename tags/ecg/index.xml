      <description>Okay I wrote a series of blog posts last year when I started at the Easter Colleges Group now I thought again before publishing these as I didnâ€™t want anyone to this this was overly critical or airing our dirty laundry. In reality simply writing the posts was theaputic.
I do once again want to note however the awesome time that I had working at the eastern colleges group and I really cannot believe how mauch we achieved in such a short time frame.</description>
