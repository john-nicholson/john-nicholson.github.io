      <description>Okay I wrote a series of blog posts last year when I started at the Easter Colleges Group now I thought again before publishing these as I didnâ€™t want anyone to this this was overly critical or airing our dirty laundry. In reality simply writing the posts was theaputic.
I do once again want to note however the awesome time that I had working at the eastern colleges group and I really cannot believe how mauch we achieved in such a short time frame.</description>

      <description>So at the beginning of the month I began a new adventure as an employee for the first time in 7 years, starting as the new Group Director for IT with Eastern Colleges Group. I really am excited about this role, there is so much to get to grips with, so many areas in which IT directly contributes to the eduction delivered by the colleges. I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting sporadically (if I ever get this blog published) with how the role is going and the challeges that we face in ensuring that the systems keep working.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve started building a new site here as a set of github pages. This has mainly involved playing with couple of site generators, and seeing how I get on with them.
My motivation in this is pretty simple I need to get better at blogging. The tooling I use is a big contributing factor to that. To that end I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out a number of platforms and here are the results.</description>
