      <description>Okay I wrote a series of blog posts last year when I started at the Easter Colleges Group now I thought again before publishing these as I didn’t want anyone to this this was overly critical or airing our dirty laundry. In reality simply writing the posts was theaputic.
I do once again want to note however the awesome time that I had working at the eastern colleges group and I really cannot believe how mauch we achieved in such a short time frame.</description>

      <description>So I thought these posts would happen more regularly; it&amp;rsquo;s just been intense getting to know so many people. Bringing together three teams distributed across our campuses has been a great deal of fun. Each is unique, with its distinct strengths and culture. Today I shared our strategy for IT across the group. While I get nervous speaking in front of people, I love these moments. It&amp;rsquo;s the big reveal of the analysis and work that has been amassed over the last 6 months.</description>

      <description>So at the beginning of the month I began a new adventure as an employee for the first time in 7 years, starting as the new Group Director for IT with Eastern Colleges Group. I really am excited about this role, there is so much to get to grips with, so many areas in which IT directly contributes to the eduction delivered by the colleges. I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting sporadically (if I ever get this blog published) with how the role is going and the challeges that we face in ensuring that the systems keep working.</description>

      <description>n.b. Plenty of great resources are avilable and I used a mixture of the offical getting started guide and some pointers for the appropriate container.
It is worth noting that I don&amp;rsquo;t like installing devkits or tools directly on my laptop. Why you ask well invariably doing starts the clock tiking on when I need to completely purge the machine. No this means I have a few options open to me:</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve started building a new site here as a set of github pages. This has mainly involved playing with couple of site generators, and seeing how I get on with them.
My motivation in this is pretty simple I need to get better at blogging. The tooling I use is a big contributing factor to that. To that end I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out a number of platforms and here are the results.</description>

      <description>I’ve had the privilege to get early access to The Unicorn Project by Gene Kim. Set within Parts Unlimited a large manufacturing and retail organisation that is struggling to come to terms with software as a first class citizen. Yes for those of you who have read The Phoenix Project this story is set in the same organisation and you see many of the same characters and events that occurred. In fact this tale follows another character within the narrative that was only briefly introduced before, namely a developer.</description>

      <description>I’ve been reading The Goal as well as The Phoenix Project. Whilst there are many important principals in these novels and I highly recommend them. I wanted to highlight one in particular. The danger of too much Inventory or unfinished work. Recently I was working on an Agile project. This team conformed to the scrum framework zealously, the application architecture was solid, the team were beyond excellent, we had fantastic and driven product owner.</description>
