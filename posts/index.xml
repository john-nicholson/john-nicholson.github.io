      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a proponent of DevOps, and my recent experiments with Hugo have led me to automate the deployment of my site. This post details how I set up an automatic deployment process for my Hugo site using GitHub Actions while keeping my drafts and content private until I&amp;rsquo;m ready to share them.
Keeping a Private Repository for Hugo Site Definition I have a private repository for my Hugo site definition to keep my draft posts and other content secure until they&amp;rsquo;re ready for the public.</description>

      <description>So I thought these posts would happen more regularly; it&amp;rsquo;s just been intense getting to know so many people. Bringing together three teams distributed across our campuses has been a great deal of fun. Each is unique, with its distinct strengths and culture. Today I shared our strategy for IT across the group. While I get nervous speaking in front of people, I love these moments. It&amp;rsquo;s the big reveal of the analysis and work that has been amassed over the last 6 months.</description>

      <description>So at the beginning of the month I began a new adventure as an employee for the first time in 7 years, starting as the new Group Director for IT with Eastern Colleges Group. I really am excited about this role, there is so much to get to grips with, so many areas in which IT directly contributes to the eduction delivered by the colleges. I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting sporadically (if I ever get this blog published) with how the role is going and the challeges that we face in ensuring that the systems keep working.</description>

      <description>Choosing the Right Environment for Hugo Development: My Journey to Containers When it comes to setting up a development environment for Hugo, there are numerous options available. My journey in selecting the most suitable one was guided by a desire for efficiency and minimal impact on my primary workstation. Here, I share my experience and rationale behind choosing containers over other methods.
Why Not Traditional Installations? Installing development tools directly on my laptop is a route I tend to avoid.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve started building a new site here as a set of github pages. This has mainly involved playing with couple of site generators, and seeing how I get on with them.
My motivation in this is pretty simple I need to get better at blogging. The tooling I use is a big contributing factor to that. To that end I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out a number of platforms and here are the results.</description>

      <description>I’ve had the privilege to get early access to The Unicorn Project by Gene Kim. Set within Parts Unlimited a large manufacturing and retail organisation that is struggling to come to terms with software as a first class citizen. Yes for those of you who have read The Phoenix Project this story is set in the same organisation and you see many of the same characters and events that occurred. In fact this tale follows another character within the narrative that was only briefly introduced before, namely a developer.</description>

      <description>I’ve been reading The Goal as well as The Phoenix Project. Whilst there are many important principals in these novels and I highly recommend them. I wanted to highlight one in particular. The danger of too much Inventory or unfinished work. Recently I was working on an Agile project. This team conformed to the scrum framework zealously, the application architecture was solid, the team were beyond excellent, we had fantastic and driven product owner.</description>
